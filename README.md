# Stack_Overflow_Developer_Survey_2021_Analysis

The questions we ask in our annual survey will help us improve the Stack Overflow community and the platform that serves them.

This year, for example, we observed a significant evolution in the way developers educate themselves. For the rising cohort of coders under the age of 18, online resources like videos and blogs are more popular than books and school combined, a statistic that doesnâ€™t hold for any of our other age cohorts. Overall, the profession is full of new joiners, with more than 50% indicating they have been coding for less than a decade, and more than 35% having less than five years in the trade.

The challenge and opportunity for us is to continue expanding and improving our ability to help all developers and to make them feel welcome in our community.
